# YogaPoseFinder

Welcome to the Yoga-Pose-Finder Gem! 
This Gem provides a list of 25 different 'Yoga for' categories, and prompts the user to choose a desired category, using CLI. 
Each category contains a list of yoga poses from which the user can choose a pose.
Each pose contains some information, like: name, sanskrit name, a short description and benefits.
After choosing a pose and getting the information, the user is asked if they would like to find another pose.
